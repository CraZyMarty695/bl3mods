Borderlands 3 Mods
==================
[![Support Discord](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Support%20Discord&logo=discord&color=424)](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R)

This is the github home to a collection of Bordlerlands 3 Mods.  At the
moment, all the mods stored here are made using the hotfix injection
method of BL3 modding, which basically just adds custom hotfixes to the
ones sent to the game by Gearbox.

Running Mods
------------

The best method for running Borderlands 3 mods is using c0dycode's [B3HM
(Borderlands 3 Hotfix Merger)](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244).
B3HM is a tool which merges in custom hotfixes for BL3 to pick up.
It's available either as a standalone EXE, or as a DLL which you can inject in
a variety of methods.  You can find B3HM in these locations:

- [B3HM at Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244)
- [B3HM at Github Releases](https://github.com/c0dycode/BL3HotfixWebUI/releases)

The B3HM project has [documentation right at its github page](https://github.com/c0dycode/BL3HotfixWebUI/wiki/B3HM-Wiki).

For the DLL version, it's recommended that you use
[FromDarkHell's BL3DX11Injection/PluginLoader](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3DX11Injection/releases)
to inject the B3HM into the Borderlands 3 process.  For the EXE version, just
download the EXE and give it a run.

See the [B3HM documentation](https://github.com/c0dycode/BL3HotfixWebUI/wiki/B3HM-Wiki) for
further information about how to use the app!  There's also an [easy-to-follow
HOWTO about running PluginLoader + B3HM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdJX7eje3v-S7INIX5ZzIvaLfzGaWjauB2rcPgPqslw),
and a [tutorial video, both by by FromDarkHell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYgUzKomXrk).

Other information (such as some info for Linux users) can be found at
[borderlandsmodding.com](http://borderlandsmodding.com/bl3-running-mods/).

Finding Mods
------------

Obviously you can just browse around this github repo to find mods that
you like, but since the mods are arranged by author, it might be difficult
to know exactly what's available.  Like for BL2/TPS mods, we've created a
[Borderlands 3 ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki)
which categorizes mods by what they do, and will probably be much easier
to work with.

Some mod authors might decide to store their BL3 mods somewhere other than
here, of course.  If any major hubs of BL3 mod distribution ever becomes
popular, we'll link it in here.  The
[Borderlands 3 section of Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3)
is likely to start accumulating these kinds of mods, once friendlier tools
are developed to make use of them.

For Mod Authors
===============

See [README-authors.md](README-authors.md) for information on both
writing BL3 mods, and contributing to this github (and associated
wiki).
