All Weapons Can Anoint
======================

There are a number of weapons in the game which can't usually spawn with
anointments.  This mod makes it so that they can.  Despite the use
of "Weapons" in the title, this also adds anointments to the Ghast Call
grenade, and the Faulty Star and Scream of Terror shields.  (The Faulty
Star technically *could* have anointments already, but was missing all
base-game anointments.)

This *does* exclude The Shoddy, since it seems quite fitting that that
gun wouldn't have anointments on it.

Should be up to date with Vault Card 3.

Changelog
=========

**v1.3.2** - Nov 19, 2021
 * Removed Linc, Leech, and Sellout because those have been officially
   patched to have anointments in the base game data.  That data patch was
   also causing crashes for Linc and Leech (but weirdly, not Sellout),
   so this release takes care of that, too.

**v1.3.1** - Aug 14, 2021
 * Added purple Seventh Sense variant, since that's actually been available
   via the Diamond Armory since DLC5.

**v1.3.0** - Jul 12, 2021
 * Added Scream of Terror shield
 * Added gear which *could* get anointments, but whose pool omitted (or
   severely restricted) base-game anointments, so that in general the only
   anointments you'd otherwise see were the Maliwan Takedown and Cartels
   additions:
   * Superstreamer (Tediore Shotgun)
   * Faulty Star shield
 * Relabeled Major Kong to Minor Kong (we had been correctly updating Minor Kong
   but was mislabelling it)

Jun 16, 2021 *(no version number change)*
 * Added contact info to mod header

**v1.2.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * Updated with DLC5 (Designer's Cut) items (which is just Res)

**v1.1.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * Updated with DLC4 items

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * First versioned release
