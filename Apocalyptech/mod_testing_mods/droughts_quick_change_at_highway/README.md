Droughts Quick Change at Highway Fast Travel
============================================

I do a lot of mod testing near the Highway fast travel in The Droughts,
since it's got the convergence of a number of useful map elements clustered
around there: Catch-A-Ride, vending machines, enemy spawns, enemy vehicle
spawns, etc.  It's also a nice relatively open area for testing map edits,
and because its GameStage is set so low, it's a nice barometer for if
Early Bloomer is working.

Anyway, one thing that's missing is a Quick Change machine, but there *is*
one of those at the Crimson Raiders' HQ back at the beginning of the level.
This mod just moves the machine over near the Highway fast travel instead.

That's all!
