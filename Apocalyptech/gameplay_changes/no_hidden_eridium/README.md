No Hidden Eridium
=================

DLC6 (Director's Cut) added in the chance for eridium clusters and
eridium jars to spawn in a 'spectral' variety which requires the
player to have a Mysterious Amulet equipped to see.  The visual
effect is neat, but this mod makes it so that all eridium cluster/jar
spawns are ordinary, and don't require the Amulet to discover.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.1** - Oct 14, 2021
 * Updated description; the hidden/spectral eridium clusters *can*
   be destroyed even without the amulet; you just have to know
   where they are, since they're not visible.  (No actual
   functionality changes.)

**v1.0.0** - Oct 11, 2021
 * Initial release
