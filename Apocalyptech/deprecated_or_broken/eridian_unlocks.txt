###
### This is the start of a mod which aims to eventually unlock the
### fancy Eridian tech to be available at the start of the game, namely:
###
###   - Resonator (breaks Eridian crystals)
###   - Analyzer (reads Eridian Writings)
###   - Mayhem Interface (mayhem mode)
###
### The Artifactor, which unlocks your artifact slot, is already unlocked
### by my Early Bloomer mod.  The Fabricator (the gun gun) doesn't
### interest me, so I'm real unlikely to bother looking into unlocking
### that one.
###
### At the moment, only the Resonator is unlocked.  I've partially figured
### out unlocking the Analyzer, though it behaves pretty weirdly so it's
### not in here yet.
###
### NOTE: this'll probably never actually be a standalone mod; if I figure
### out other unlocks in the future, I'm likely to just fold it into
### Early Bloomer, as I did with the Resonator.
